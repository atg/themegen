I have m items and n bins. Assuming that bins cannot be empty, how many ways are there of arranging the items in the bins?


Each set can have all k-subsets where 0 < k < m. Additionally, if 1 < k < m - 1 then there are further possibilities. Consider

X: {a, b}
Y: {c}
Z: {d}

and

X: {a, b}
Y: {d}
Z: {c}
